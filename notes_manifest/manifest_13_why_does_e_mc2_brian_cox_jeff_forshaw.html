					    <li> The existence of such a special speed, a cosmic speed limit, is a strange concept...</li>

					    <li> To find the flaw in Aristotle's answer, let us accept his picture for a moment and see where it leads...</li>

					    <li> This constantly shifting view of the position of the earth, the planets, and their motion through the heavens should serve as a lesson to anyone who is absolutely convinced that they know something...</li>

					    <li> This is a very powerful way of sorting out the wheat from the chaff in a world full of diverse ideas and opinions...</li>
					    <li> This might all seem rather philosophical, but in fact such musings lead to a profound conclusion about the nature of space itself, and they allow us to take the first step along the path to Einstein's theories of relativity...</li>

					    <li> Maxwell's equations are mathematically rather more complicated, but in essence they do exactly the same kind of job...</li>
					    <li> To return to our story, in his quest for mathematical consistency, Maxwell added the extra piece, known as the displacement current, to the equation describing Faraday's experimental observations of the deflection of compass needles produced by electric currents flowing in wires...</li>
					    <li> What are these mysterious oscillating fields?...</li>

					Einstein's Axioms based on Maxwell's Equations
				</div>
				<div class="row manifest_content" style="display:none;">
					<ul class="manifest_ul" style="color:lightblue; padding-right:50px">
						<li> In Chapter 1 we succeeded in establishing that the very intuitive Aristotelian view of space and time was laden with excess baggage...</li>
						<li> Albert Einstein is undoubtedly the iconic figure of modern science...</li>
						<li> What is striking is his persistence in countinuing to explore the important scientific problems of the day while being overlooked for university-level academic positions...</li>
						<li> Most of this book deals with Einstein's work leading up to and encompassing his golden year of 1905, in which he first wrote down E = mc^2, was finally awarded his PhD, and completed a paper on the photoelectric effect, for which he eventually won the Nobel Prize...</li>
						<li> Einstein's inspiration on the road to E = mc^2 was the mathematical beauty of Maxwell's equations, which impressed him to such a degree that he decided to take seriously the prediction that the speed of light is a constant...</li>
						<li> At the heart of Einstein's theory of special relativity lie two proposals, which in the language of physics are termed axioms...</li>
						<li> The first of Einstein's axioms is that Maxwell's equations hold true in the sense that light always travels through empty space that the same speed regardless of the motion of the source or the observer...</li>
						<li> Therefore, our goal for the next few pages is to work out the consequences of Einstein's axioms...</li>
						<li> Now, imagine putting the light clock on a train that is whizzing along past someone standing on a station platform...</li>
						<li> It is very important to emphasize that this conclusion is not specific to light clocks...</li>
						<li> The upshort is that we must either cling to the comforting notion of absolute time and ditch Maxwell's equations, or ditch absolute time in favor of Maxwell and Einstein...</li>
						<li> To design such an experiment, first we need to work out how fast something should move in order to reveal the proposed effect...</li>
						<li> Take a look at Figure 2 again and suppose that the time taken for half of one tick of the clock on the train as measured by the person standing on the platform is equal to T... We are nearly done now...</li>
						<li> Returning to the task at hand, we can now write the time taken for one tick of the clock as determined by someone on the platform: It is the time for light to travel up to the top mirror and back down again -- that is 2T...</li>
						<li> Now we are done with the mathematics--we have succeeded in figuring out exactly how much time slows down on the train as determined by someone on the platform...</li>
						<li> Before we discuss an experiment that settles the argument, let us pause to reflect upon the result that we just uncovered...</li>
						<li> As we have just seen, the effect is a tiny one for real trains, which don't travel anywhere near as fast as the speed of light, but it is real nonetheless...</li>

					Experimental method
				</div>
				<div class="row manifest_content" style="display:none;">
					<ul class="manifest_ul" style="color:lightblue; padding-right:50px">
						<li> In real experiments, if we are to test this breakdown in absolute time, then we need to find a way to investigate objects that can move close to the speed of light, for only then will the time-stretching factor gamma become measurably larger than 1...</li>
						<li> Fortunately for scientists, such objects do exists; in fact, scientists themselves are built out of them...</li>
						<li> The electron is a particle to which we are all indepted, because we are built out of them...</li>
						<li> Here is where the mathematics we did earlier in this chapter becomes very valuable... It's worth taking a brief pause here to ponder what has happened...</li>
						<li> We must therefore conclude, because experiment tells us so, that time is malleable...</li>
						<li> As if this rather unsettling behavior of time isn't enough, something else is lurking, and the alert reader may have spotted it...</li>
						<li> The discovery that the passage of time can be slowed down and distances can be shrunk is strange enough when applied to the realm of subatomic particles, but Einstein's reasoning applies equally well to things the size of humans...</li>

					    <li> This is not a history book. Our aim is to describe space and time in the most enlightening way we can, and it is our view that the historical road to relativity does not necessarily provide the best path to enlightenment...</li>
					    <li> Here is the starting point. Einstein's theories can be constructed almost entirely using the language of geometry...</li>
					    <li> Invariance is a concept that lies at the core of modern physics...</li>

					    <li> The tool that allows us to search for and exploit these properties of nature is mathematics...</li>

					    <li> What has causality got to do with spacetime and, in particular, distances in spacetime?..</li>
					    <li> Time now to return to the challenge of developing the concept of distance in spacetime...</li>
					    <li> There are other familiar Euclidean properties that are not obeyed on the surface of the earth...</li>
					    <li> We already introduced the concepts we will need when we thought about getting out of bed and finishing breakfast in the kitchen...</li>
					    <li> What we are doing implicitly in speaking of "the distance in time" is treating time as an additional dimension...</li>
					    <li> Let us continue in a gentler vain for a moment by noticing something very simple: Things happen...</li>
					    <li> Let's take the moment when I wake up in bed as our first event in spacetime...</li>
					    <li> If we are to compute distances in spacetime, then we have an immediate problem to resolve...</li>
					    <li> This is progress; we now have time and distance intervals in the same currency...</li>
					    <li> We have to decide on a means of measuring the length of the hypotenuse, the distance between two events in spacetime...</li>
					    <li> Flipping the sign means that the mathematics is not much of an extension over the by now fmiliar equation of Pythagoras...</li>
					    <li> We are now about to plunge into a very elegant but perhaps tricky piece of reasoning...</li>
					    <li> To settle the question of the plus or minus sign, we need to turn our attention to causality...</li>
					    <li> We know that the spatial distance between O and A is x = 10 meters and the distance in time between the two events is t = 1 hour, where x and t are measured by me...</li>
					    <li> The fact that two different observers can disagree on the values of x and t, provided s is the same, has a very important consequence, which can be visualized quite simply...</li>
					    <li> As an aside, pictures like the ones shown in Figures 4 and 5 are called "spacetime diagrams" and they often help us work out what is going on...</li>
					    <li> We are faced with what the English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley famously described as "the great tragedy of science--the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact."...</li>
					    <li> Our next and in fact only remaining hypothesis is that the distance between points in spacetime is to be calculated using s^2 = (ct)^2-x^2...</li>
					    <li> To answer this question we need once again to take a look at the lines in spacetime that lie a constant distance s from O...</li>
					    <li> It's worth repeating this because it is one of the most important points in the book...</li>
					    <li> We've just completed a subtle piece of reasoning...</li>
					    <li> Remember, we needed c in ordered to have any change of defining the notion of distance in spacetime, because we had to measure space and time in the same currency, but so far we have no idea what i actually represents...</li>
					    <li> How are we to restore causality to our theory of spacetime?</li>
					    <li> Let us imagine the alien-laser-exploding-alarm-clock incident again, but now subject it to a cosmic speed limit...</li>
					    <li> As illustrated in the figure, we are supposing that B happens just before O such that it lies in the right-hand wedge region, which is the "dangerous" region for causality...</li>
					    <li> To interpret the delineating lines, look again at our spacetime diagrams...</li>

					    <li> In the first instance, energy is an easier concept to grasp than momentum...</li>
					    <li> That said, and as with the conservation of momentum, the conservation of energy was first discovered experimentally...</li>
					    <li> Ask someone on the street to explain what energy is and you'll get either a sensible answer or a pile of streaming New Age nonsense...</li>
					    <li> To see energy conservation in action in a simple system, let us return to the colliding billiard balls for the final time...</li>
					    <li> Now let us get back to the point. We introduced momentum as an example of a quantity that is described by an arrow and, along with energy, its utility arises out of the fact that it is a conserved quantity...</li>
					    <li> Let's take a closer look at the three-dimensional momentum vector...</li>
					    <li> We have succeeded in constructin gthe momentum vector of a ball in three-dimensional space, although it is hardly the most exciting thing we have done...</li>
					    <li> Again we shall start with an arrow, this time pointing in four dimensional spacetime, as illustrated in Figure 12...</li>
					    <li> We want to construct something that is an improvement over the old three-dimensional momentum...</li>
					    <li> This all might feel rather familiar, and that is because it should be familiar...</li>
					    <li> To finish our construction of the new spacetime momentum arrow, all we need to do is multiply the spacetime velocity vector by the mass m...</li>
					    <li> To delve a little deeper, we will now take a look at the portions of our new spacetime momentum vector that point in the space and time directions separately...</li>
					    <li> Recall that we arrived at an expression for the length of the momentum vector in three-dimensional space, m delta x / delta t...</li>
					    <li> We are actually nearly where we want to be. The whole point of that piece of mathematics is that it allowes us to figure out by exactly how much the momentum vector points off in the space and time directions separately...</li>
					    <li> Now that really is interesting--the momentum vector in spacetime that we just constructed is not boring at all...</li>
					    <li> More interesting than the fact that we have modified p = mv is what happens when we consider that part of the momentum vector that points off in the time direction...</li>
					    <li> Remember, momentum is interesting to us because it is conserved. Our goal has been to find a new, four-dimensional momentum that will be conserved in spacetime...</li>
					    <li> What can we say about the conservation of gamma m c?...</li>
				    	<li> It has taken us a long time to reach this point, but there is a sting in the tail of this narrative.

					    <li> Our friend Thales of Miletus can at least achieve complete enchantment...</li>
					    <li> Let's recap: We wanted to look for an object in spacetime that did the job of momentum in three-dimensional space, because momentum is a conserved quantity and therefore useful...</li>
					    <li> What does this all mean? We have established that energy is an interesting quantity because it is conserved: "You can increase energy over here provided you lower it over there." Moreover, we have established that the raw mass of an object provides a potential source of energy...</li>
					    <li> Before we unpick that rather strong statement, a further word on what we mean by "destroyed" is probably in order...</li>
					    <li> Now for the grand finale... The answer can be found in another bizarre and well-hidden feature of Einstein's mass-energy equation...</li>
					    <li> This is is pretty profound stuff. The c in E = mc^2 has something to do with light only because of the experimental fact that particles of light just happen to be massless...</li>

					    <li> Let us make one final point before we move on....It took humans around a half century after Einstein before they eventually figured out how to extract significant amounts of mass energy from matter, and the destruction of mass is exploited today by nuclear power plants...</li>

					<ul class="manifest_ul" style="color:lightblue; padding-right:50px">

					    <li> We have seen how Einstein's famous equation forces us to reconsider the way we think about mass...</li>
					    <li> Rmember, this version of E = gamma m c^2 is only an approximation, although a pretty good one for speeds even as high as 20 percent of the speed of light...</li>
					    <li> Imagine a bucket of armed mousetraps, all storing energy in the springs...</li>
					    <li> The conversion of mass to energy is therefore not such an exotic process..</li>
					    <li> The process of converting mass into energy and energy into mass is therefore absolutely fundamental to the workings of nature; it really is an everyday occurrence...</li>
					    <li> Here lies another insight into science. With each new level of understanding, a more accurate worlview emerges...</li>
					    <li> All of the examples we just looked at lead to very tiny fractional changes in mass, but of coure the release of the corresponding energy can be very significant...</li>
					    <li> Because particle physicists are as lazy as the next guy, they don't like writing very small numbers down with lots of zeros and decimal places, so they don't usually use kilograms to measure mass...</li>
					    <li> Notice also that the mass of a hydrogen atom is smaller, not bigger, than the sum of its component parts...</li>
					    <li> That said, one has to be very careful in picturing electron orbits, because they are not really like the orbits of planets around the sun...</li>
					    <li> All of this does beg the question of how we know such fine detail about hydrogen atoms...</li>
					    <li> Perhaps the most everyday way of getting energy into atoms is to heat them up...</li>
					    <li> All of the atoms in nature come in a tower of energies (or masses), depending on where the electrons are, and since there is more than a single electron in every atom except hydrogen, the light emitted from them spans all the colors of the rainbow and beyond, which is ultimately the reason why the world is so colorful...</li>
					    <li> As everyone who has spent time in a school chemistry lab with a box of matches and an inattentive teacher knows, cchemeical reactions can sometimes lead to the production of energy...</li>
					    <li> A final exammple may serve to furhter illustrate the idea of energy release through chemical reactions...</li>
					    <li> Liberating chemical energy by shuffling atoms around or gravitational energy by shuffling heavy things around (like huge volumes of water in hydroelectric plants) provides our civilization with a means to generate and harness energy...</li>
					    <li> The energy released in chemical reactions has been the primary source of power for our civilization since prehistoric times...</li>
					    <li> Deep inside the atom lies the nucleus--a bunch of protons and neutrons stuck together by the glue of the strong nuclear fource...</li>
					    <li> The heavy element uranium has 92 protons and, in its most stable naturally occurring form, 146 neutrons... </li>
						<li> The technique is beautifully simple... Take two protons (no electrons around this time, so we have no chance to make them stick together in a hydrogen molecule)...</li>
						<li> How does all of that fit with our understanding of energy?...</li>
						<li> Squeezing two protons together to make a deuteron is one way to liberate the energy bound up in the strong force, and it is an example of nuclear fusion...</li>
						<li> Let us journey back in time to the cosmic dark age, less than half a billion years after the big bang when the universe is filled with only hydrogen, helium, and a sprinkling of the lighter chemical elements...</li>
						<li> Our sun is a start that is currently in just such a comfortable midlife phase: It is burning hydrogen to make helium...</li>
						<li> The process of burning helium is really worht a closer look...</li>

						<li> Today we have a great deal more evidence that supports the theory of stellar evolution...</li>
						<li> Eventually, the star will exhaust its supply of helium and begin to collapse even further...</li>
						<li> With no other source of energy available to previent the inevitable, a start that has an iron-rich core is really a the point of no return, and gravity resumes its relentless work...</li>
						<li> It has been our goal throughout this book to be careful to explain why things are as they are and to provide arguments and evidence as we progress...</li>
						<li> Are all starts fated to end their lives as white dwarf starts?...</li>
